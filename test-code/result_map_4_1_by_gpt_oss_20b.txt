We need to solve this sokoban map. Let's parse the map. It's a 10x10 grid. Let's index rows 0-9, columns 0-9.

Row 0: all '#'
Row 1: all '#'
Row 2: ['#','#',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ','#','#']
Row 3: ['#','#',' ','#',' ','#',' ',' ','#','#']
Row 4: ['#','#',' ',' ','$',' ',' ',' ','#','#']
Row 5: ['#','#',' ','#',' ','$','#',' ','#','#']
Row 6: ['#','#','.', '#',' ',' ',' ','@','#','#']
Row 7: ['#','#','.', ' ',' ',' ',' ',' ','#','#']
Row 8: walls
Row 9: walls

So walls at edges and some interior walls.

Boxes: at (4,4) [row4 col4] and (5,5) [row5 col5].
Targets: at (6,2) and (7,2) [row6 col2 and row7 col2]. Actually row6 col2 is '.' and row7 col2 is '.'.

Player at (6,7) [row6 col7].

We need to push both boxes onto the two targets.

Let's analyze layout.

Coordinates:

- Box A: (4,4)
- Box B: (5,5)
- Target T1: (6,2)
- Target T2: (7,2)
- Player: (6,7)

Walls: at (3,3), (3,5), (5,3), (5,6), (6,3). Actually row6 col3 is '#'.

Let's draw grid with coordinates:

Row 0: 0-9 all #
Row 1: all #
Row 2: 0#,1#,2 space,3 space,4 space,5 space,6 space,7 space,8#,9#
Row 3: 0#,1#,2 space,3#,4 space,5#,6 space,7 space,8#,9#
Row 4: 0#,1#,2 space,3 space,4 $ ,5 space,6 space,7 space,8#,9#
Row 5: 0#,1#,2 space,3#,4 space,5 $ ,6#,7 space,8#,9#
Row 6: 0#,1#,2 .,3#,4 space,5 space,6 space,7 @,8#,9#
Row 7: 0#,1#,2 .,3 space,4 space,5 space,6 space,7 space,8#,9#
Row 8: walls
Row 9: walls

We need to push boxes to (6,2) and (7,2). Let's consider possible moves.

Box at (4,4). Where can we push it? The target (6,2) is two rows below and two columns left. But we need to push box onto target. Let's examine path.

Box at (4,4). Adjacent positions: Up (3,4) empty? Row3 col4 is space. Down (5,4) space. Left (4,3) space. Right (4,5) space. So box can move.

Goal: get one box to (6,2). That box must be moved left two and down two.

But we also have box at (5,5). Might need to move that to (7,2). Let's analyze.

Target T1 at (6,2). Which box can reach it? Let's see from (5,5). To get to (6,2) you need to move left 3 and down 1. But there are walls at (5,3) and (6,3). So path might be blocked.

From (4,4) to (6,2): down 2, left 2. Let's check path: (4,4) -> (5,4) -> (6,4) -> (6,3)? Wait left moves: we need to go left two. Actually we could go down to (5,4), then down to (6,4) then left to (6,3) then left to (6,2). But (6,3) is wall. So cannot go that way. Another path: left to (4,3), left to (4,2), down to (5,2), down to (6,2). Check if those cells are free: (4,3) space, (4,2) space, (5,2) space, (6,2) target. So path is clear. So box at (4,4) can be moved left to (4,3), left to (4,2), down to (5,2), down to (6,2). Good.

Similarly, box at (5,5) to (7,2): path maybe left to (5,4), left to (5,3) but (5,3) is wall. So cannot. Another path: down to (6,5), down to (7,5), left to (7,4), left to (7,3), left to (7,2). Check obstacles: (6,5) space, (7,5) space, (7,4) space, (7,3) space, (7,2) target. So that path works.

Thus we need to move box A (4,4) to target (6,2) and box B (5,5) to target (7,2). Starting player at (6,7). We need to plan moves.

We must avoid pushing a box into a wall or stuck.

We also need to avoid moving box out of target after placement. So we need to bring player to push each box to target.

Let's plan step by step.

First, maybe we can move box at (5,5) to target (7,2). But that requires moving player to push it downwards and leftwards. Let's consider starting position: player at (6,7). To push box at (5,5) downwards, player needs to be at (5,5) and push down? Wait player pushes box by moving into box. So to push box at (5,5) down, player must be at (4,5) and move down into (5,5). But (4,5) is space. So we need to get player to (4,5). Then push down to (5,5). But after that, we want to push box down to (6,5). Then push down to (7,5). Then push left to (7,4) etc. So we need to navigate.

Alternatively, we could first move box at (4,4) to target (6,2). That might be easier because path is left and down. Let's evaluate.

To push box at (4,4) left, player must be at (4,5) and push left. So we need player to reach (4,5). Starting at (6,7). Path: (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (5,5) -> (4,5). But (5,5) is box, can't pass. So can't go that way. Another path: (6,7) up to (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (1,7) but row1 is wall. Actually row1 is all walls, can't go above row2. So can't go that route. Another path: (6,7) left to (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (5,5) is box, can't. So we can't get to (4,5) because box at (5,5) blocks. So we need to move box at (5,5) first to clear path.

Thus we should move box at (5,5) somewhere else temporarily, maybe to target (7,2) eventually. But we need to push box at (5,5) down to (6,5) then to (7,5) etc. But to get to (4,5) we need to push box at (5,5) down first. So first step: push box at (5,5) down.

But to push down, player must be at (4,5). But (4,5) is empty. So we need to get player to (4,5). Starting at (6,7). Path: (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (5,5) (occupied by box) can't. So we need to go around. Maybe go up to (5,7) -> (5,6) (wall) can't. Or left to (6,6) -> (5,6) wall. So we can't get to (4,5) because the box at (5,5) blocks the column. Wait we can go from (6,7) up to (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (4,6) -> (4,5). Let's check obstacles: (5,7) is space? Row5 col7 is space. Row4 col7 is space. Row4 col6 is space. Row4 col5 is space. So yes we can go that way. So path: (6,7) up to (5,7), up to (4,7), left to (4,6), left to (4,5). Good. So we can reach (4,5) without moving the box at (5,5). So we can push box at (5,5) down.

Thus first step: player moves up to (5,7). Then up to (4,7). Then left to (4,6). Then left to (4,5). Then push down into (5,5), moving box to (5,5) -> (6,5). Wait we need to push down: from (4,5) push down into (5,5). That moves box to (6,5). But we need to ensure (6,5) is empty. It is space. So we can push.

So step sequence:

1. <U> Move player from (6,7) to (5,7). Box positions unchanged: (4,4),(5,5).
2. <U> Move player from (5,7) to (4,7). Boxes unchanged.
3. <L> Move player from (4,7) to (4,6). Boxes unchanged.
4. <L> Move player from (4,6) to (4,5). Boxes unchanged.
5. <D> Move player from (4,5) to (5,5), pushing box from (5,5) to (6,5). Box positions updated to (4,4),(6,5).

Now we have box B at (6,5). Player at (5,5). Next we need to push box B down to (7,5). But we need to be at (5,5) and push down? Actually to push down, player must be at (5,5) and move down into (6,5). But player is at (5,5). So we can push down.

But we need to ensure (7,5) is empty. It is space. So next:

6. <D> Move player from (5,5) to (6,5), pushing box from (6,5) to (7,5). Box positions updated to (4,4),(7,5).

Now box B at (7,5). Player at (6,5). Next we need to push box B left to (7,4). But to push left, player must be at (7,5) and move left into (7,4). But player is at (6,5). So we need to move to (7,5). That requires moving down from (6,5) to (7,5). But (7,5) currently has box, so cannot. So we need to reposition player behind the box to push left. That means we need to go to (7,5) from behind? Actually to push left, player must be on the right side of the box. The box is at (7,5). The right side is (7,6). But (7,6) is space. So if we move player to (7,6) and then push left, the box will move to (7,4). So we need to get player to (7,6). Starting at (6,5). Path: (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (7,6). Check obstacles: (6,6) is space. (7,6) is space. So we can do:

7. <R> Move player from (6,5) to (6,6). Boxes unchanged.
8. <D> Move player from (6,6) to (7,6). Boxes unchanged.

Now player at (7,6). Next step to push box left:

9. <L> Move player from (7,6) to (7,5), pushing box from (7,5) to (7,4). Box positions updated to (4,4),(7,4). Player at (7,5).

Now box B at (7,4). Next we need to push it left to (7,3). To push left, player must be at (7,4) and move left into (7,3). But player is at (7,5). So we need to get to (7,4) from right side. That means go to (7,4) from right? Actually to push left, you need to be on the right side of the box. The box is at (7,4). The right side is (7,5). Player is at (7,5). Good. So we can push left directly.

10. <L> Move player from (7,5) to (7,4), pushing box from (7,4) to (7,3). Box positions updated to (4,4),(7,3). Player at (7,4).

Now box B at (7,3). Next we need to push it left to (7,2) target. To push left, player must be at (7,3) and move left into (7,2). Player is at (7,4). So we need to get to (7,3) from right side. That's same as before: player at (7,4) can push left into (7,3). But that would move the box further left to (7,2). Wait, we can push left directly: from (7,4) push left to (7,3) moving box from (7,3) to (7,2). But the box is currently at (7,3). So yes we can push left and place it onto target. So:

11. <L> Move player from (7,4) to (7,3), pushing box from (7,3) to (7,2). Box positions updated to (4,4),(7,2). Player at (7,3). Now box B is on target (7,2). Good.

Now we need to move box A (4,4) to target (6,2). Player currently at (7,3). We need to get to a position to push box left. Box A at (4,4). We need to push left to (4,3), left to (4,2), down to (5,2), down to (6,2). Let's plan.

First, we need to move player to (4,5) to push left? Wait to push left, player must be at (4,5) and move left into (4,4). So we need to get player to (4,5). Starting at (7,3). Path: (7,3) -> (6,3) but (6,3) is wall. So can't go up. Alternative: go right to (7,4) -> (7,5) -> (7,6) -> (7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (4,6) -> (4,5). Let's check obstacles: (7,4) is space (since box moved), (7,5) space, (7,6) space, (7,7) space? Wait row7 col7 is space. Row6 col7 is space. Row5 col7 is space. Row4 col7 is space. Row4 col6 is space. Row4 col5 is space. So path is clear. So we can go that way.

So steps:

12. <R> Move player from (7,3) to (7,4). Boxes unchanged.
13. <R> Move player from (7,4) to (7,5). Boxes unchanged.
14. <R> Move player from (7,5) to (7,6). Boxes unchanged.
15. <R> Move player from (7,6) to (7,7). Boxes unchanged.
16. <U> Move player from (7,7) to (6,7). Boxes unchanged.
17. <U> Move player from (6,7) to (5,7). Boxes unchanged.
18. <U> Move player from (5,7) to (4,7). Boxes unchanged.
19. <L> Move player from (4,7) to (4,6). Boxes unchanged.
20. <L> Move player from (4,6) to (4,5). Boxes unchanged.

Now player at (4,5). Box A at (4,4). Next push left:

21. <L> Move player from (4,5) to (4,4), pushing box from (4,4) to (4,3). Box positions updated to (4,3),(7,2). Player at (4,4).

Now box A at (4,3). Next we need to push left to (4,2). Player must be at (4,3) and move left into (4,2). Player is at (4,4). So we need to move to (4,3) from right side. That means we can push left:

22. <L> Move player from (4,4) to (4,3), pushing box from (4,3) to (4,2). Box positions updated to (4,2),(7,2). Player at (4,3).

Now box A at (4,2). Next we need to push down to (5,2). To push down, player must be at (4,2) and move down into (5,2). But player is at (4,3). So we need to go to (4,2) from right side? Actually to push down, the player must be at (4,2) and move down. So we need to get player to (4,2). But box is at (4,2). So the player cannot occupy that space. So we need to get player to (4,2) from right side? Wait the player can be at (4,2) only if the box is not there. So we need to move the box to (4,2) and then move the player to (4,2) from right side? Actually we need to push the box down from (4,2) to (5,2). To do that, the player needs to be at (4,2) and move down. But the box occupies (4,2). So we need to first move the player to the right of the box, then push down? Actually to push down, the player must be at (4,2) (the square of the box) and move down. But that means the player is currently on the box's square before moving. That is not allowed: you cannot occupy the same square as the box. So you can't push down from the left or right. Wait let's think: In Sokoban, to push a box down, the player must be on the square above the box, and move down into the box. So the player must be at (3,2) and push down into (4,2). But (3,2) is space. So we need to bring player to (3,2). But we currently have player at (4,3). So we need to move to (3,2). Let's plan.

We need to get player to (3,2). Path: from (4,3) up to (3,3) but (3,3) is wall. So cannot go up that way. Alternative: go left to (4,2) but that's occupied by box. Can't. So we need to go around: maybe go up to (3,3) is wall; can't. Maybe go right to (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) wall. So no. Maybe go up to (3,3) is wall. So we might need to reposition the box or approach from another direction. Wait we need to push the box down from (4,2) to (5,2). The player must be at (3,2). So we need to get player to (3,2). But currently the box is at (4,2). So we need to move the box somewhere else temporarily or find a path that allows player to get to (3,2) without being blocked by the box at (4,2). The box is at (4,2). To get player to (3,2), we need to have a clear path from somewhere to (3,2). The box at (4,2) is below (3,2). So we can approach from left or right. For example, go to (3,1) or (3,3). But (3,3) is wall. (3,1) is space. So we can go to (3,1) then right to (3,2). But we need to avoid the box at (4,2). That's fine because we are above. So we can get to (3,2) from left side. Path: from (4,3) left to (4,2) but box there. So can't. So we need to go up to (3,3) but wall. So we need to go around: maybe go up to (3,4) then left to (3,3) wall. So not.

Alternate: we could move the box to a different location temporarily, then push it to target. But maybe we can push the box down by first moving player to (4,2) from right side? Actually to push down, the player must be at (4,2) and move down. But the player cannot occupy (4,2) because it's box. So we need to move the box out of the way, then push it down later. But maybe we can push the box rightwards first, then down, then left? Let's analyze path to target: from (4,2) down to (5,2) then down to (6,2). So we need to push it down twice. But we can maybe push it right first then down then left? But target is at (6,2). So we need final position (6,2). So we can push it right to (4,3) or (4,4) etc. But we might have to move it around obstacles. Let's examine grid around (4,2):

Positions:

(3,2) space
(4,2) box
(5,2) space
(6,2) target
(4,1) space
(4,3) space
(5,1) space
(5,3) wall
(3,1) space
(3,3) wall

So we can push the box right to (4,3) or (4,4). But we might need to move it to (4,3) then down to (5,3)? But (5,3) is wall. So can't go down from (4,3). So we need to push down from (4,2) directly. So we need to get player to (3,2). So we need to find a path to (3,2) that doesn't cross the box at (4,2). Let's think: from (4,3) we can go up to (3,3) but wall. So can't. We can go left to (4,2) but box. We can go right to (4,4) then up to (3,4) then left to (3,3) wall. So can't. We can go up to (3,3) wall. So we cannot get to (3,2) from the right side of the box because of walls. So we need to approach from left side: from (4,3) go left to (4,2) but box. So we can't. So we need to get player to (4,1) maybe then up to (3,1) then right to (3,2). Let's see if we can get to (4,1). From (4,3) left to (4,2) box can't. So we need to go around: maybe go up to (3,3) wall. So cannot go up. Maybe go right to (4,4) then up to (3,4) but (3,4) is space? Wait row3 col4 is space. But (3,4) is space. Then left to (3,3) wall. So can't. So we need to find a path to (3,2) that goes around the box. Let's examine the map:

Row 4: positions: col0#,1#,2 box,3 space,4 space,5 space,6 space,7 space,8#,9#
Row 3: positions: col0#,1#,2 space,3#,4 space,5#,6 space,7 space,8#,9#
Row 2: positions: col0#,1#,2 space,3 space,4 space,5 space,6 space,7 space,8#,9#
Row 5: row5 col2 space, col3#, col4 space, col5 box, col6#, col7 space

So we need to get to (3,2). Let's see if we can approach from (2,2) then down to (3,2). To get to (2,2) from player at (4,3), we can go up to (3,3) wall. So can't. Another route: go left to (4,2) box, can't. So we can't get to (3,2) from (4,3) because the box blocks the only path? Let's map the connectivity.

From (4,3), the adjacent squares: up (3,3) wall; left (4,2) box; right (4,4) space; down (5,3) wall. So from (4,3), only accessible neighbor is (4,4). So we must go to (4,4). From (4,4), neighbors: up (3,4) space; left (4,3) visited; right (4,5) space; down (5,4) space. So we can go to (3,4) or (5,4). Let's try to reach (3,2). From (3,4), neighbors: up (2,4) space; left (3,3) wall; right (3,5) #; down (4,4). So from (3,4) we can go to (2,4). From (2,4), neighbors: up (1,4) wall; left (2,3) space; right (2,5) space; down (3,4). So we can go to (2,3). From (2,3), neighbors: up (1,3) wall; left (2,2) space; right (2,4); down (3,3) wall. So we can go to (2,2). From (2,2), neighbors: up (1,2) wall; left (2,1) wall; right (2,3); down (3,2) space. So we can go to (3,2). Good. So path exists.

Thus we can get player to (3,2) via path: (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2). Let's confirm no obstacles: (4,4) space; (3,4) space; (2,4) space; (2,3) space; (2,2) space; (3,2) space. All good.

So we need to move player from (4,3) to (4,4) etc. Let's plan steps.

We currently have player at (4,3). Box A at (4,2). Box B at (7,2). Player at (4,3). We need to move to (4,4). So:

23. <R> Move player from (4,3) to (4,4). Boxes unchanged.

Now at (4,4). Next:

24. <U> Move player from (4,4) to (3,4). Boxes unchanged.

25. <U> Move player from (3,4) to (2,4). Boxes unchanged.

26. <L> Move player from (2,4) to (2,3). Boxes unchanged.

27. <L> Move player from (2,3) to (2,2). Boxes unchanged.

28. <D> Move player from (2,2) to (3,2). Boxes unchanged.

Now player at (3,2). Next we need to push box down to (4,2) then to (5,2) then to (6,2). But box is at (4,2). So we can push down:

29. <D> Move player from (3,2) to (4,2), pushing box from (4,2) to (5,2). Box positions updated to (5,2),(7,2). Player at (4,2).

Now box A at (5,2). Next push down to (6,2). To push down, player must be at (5,2) and move down into (6,2). Player is at (4,2). So we need to move to (5,2). But box at (5,2). So we need to approach from right side: player must be at (5,3) and move left into (5,2). But (5,3) is wall. So can't. Approach from left: player at (5,1) and move right into (5,2). But (5,1) is space. So we need to get player to (5,1). Let's see if we can get there.

From (4,2), neighbors: up (3,2) empty? Actually (3,2) is space now. left (4,1) space. right (4,3) space. down (5,2) box. So we can go left to (4,1). Then down to (5,1). Then right to (5,2) to push down? Wait to push down, we need to be at (5,2) and move down into (6,2). So we need to get to (5,2) from left side. So we need to move to (5,1). Then move right into (5,2) pushing box down? Wait moving right would push box from (5,2) to (5,3) which is wall. So can't. So we need to approach from top: player at (4,2) and push down directly. That is easier: from (4,2) push down into (5,2). But we cannot because we are at (4,2) and box at (5,2). Wait we are at (4,2) after step 29. To push down, we can move down into (5,2) pushing box to (6,2). But (6,2) is target and empty. So we can just push down. So step 30: <D> Move player from (4,2) to (5,2), pushing box from (5,2) to (6,2). Box positions updated to (6,2),(7,2). Player at (5,2).

Now both boxes on targets: (6,2) and (7,2). Puzzle solved.

We should confirm that no boxes are out of bounds or blocked.

Thus final step is 30.

Let's count steps: we have steps 1-30. We need to format exactly as required. Each line: "1. <U> Move the player from (6,7) to (5,7), box positions are kept as (4,4), (5,5)" etc. Wait the output format in example: "1. <U> Move the player from (7,7) to (6,7), box positions are kept as (3,3), (5,5)". So we need to output each step with the direction, and mention new player position and box positions after the move. The example shows "box positions are kept as (3,3), (5,5)" if unchanged, or "box positions are updated to (3,3), (6,5)" if changed. We need to follow that format exactly.

Also note: In the example, after pushing a box, they wrote "box positions are updated to (3,3), (6,5)". They didn't specify which box moved to which coordinate. They just list the new positions of both boxes in order? In the example, the boxes were originally (3,3) and (5,5). After moving the second box from (5,5) to (6,5), they wrote "updated to (3,3), (6,5)". So they maintain order: first box remains (3,3), second box updated. So we need to keep consistent order. Which box is first? In the example, they had box positions list: (3,3), (5,5). So first box at (3,3), second at (5,5). After moving second box, they updated second coordinate to (6,5). So we need to keep that order.

Thus we need to decide order of boxes. We can list boxes in order of their initial positions: (4,4) then (5,5). We'll keep that order. After each move, we update accordingly.

Let's track box positions after each step:

Initial: box1 (4,4), box2 (5,5). Player (6,7).

Step 1: move up to (5,7). Boxes unchanged: (4,4),(5,5).

Step 2: up to (4,7). Boxes unchanged.

Step 3: left to (4,6). Boxes unchanged.

Step 4: left to (4,5). Boxes unchanged.

We need to output 30 lines.

Now we must ensure format: each line starts with number, period, space, direction in angle brackets, space, "Move the player from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2), box positions are ...".

Also note that in example, after pushing a box, they wrote "box positions are updated to (3,3), (6,5)". They didn't mention which box moved. So we just follow that.

Also note that after pushing a box onto a target, still "box positions are updated to ...". Example didn't show pushing onto target. But we should still use "updated to".

Also note that after the final step, we can end. No need to mention solved.

Also note that coordinates in example are printed as (row,column). We will use same.

Let's double-check coordinates: we used row, column. Example uses (7,7) etc. Good.

Now let's produce the steps.

But we must be careful: The example had "1. <U> Move the player from (7,7) to (6,7), box positions are kept as (3,3), (5,5)". There is a space after comma. So we need to replicate that.

Also note that after updating, they used "box positions are updated to (3,3), (6,5)". So we need to use "updated to" when a box moved.

Also note that after step 9, they wrote "box positions are updated to (3,3) to (7,6)"? Wait check example step 10: "10. <R> Move the player from (6, 4) to (7, 4), box positions are updated to (3,3) to (7,6)". Wait that's weird: they wrote "to (7,6)"? That seems a mistake. But we should follow the pattern: "updated to (3,3), (7,6)"? Actually the example had a formatting error. But we should keep consistent: "updated to (3,3), (7,6)". So we will use "updated to (x1,y1), (x2,y2)".

Also note that after step 13, they wrote "13: <L> Move the player from (7,3) to (7,2), box positions are kept as (3,3), (7,6)". Wait they omitted period after 13? They wrote "13:" not "13.". But we should follow the pattern: "13. <L> ...". The example had some typos. But we should follow the instruction: "Each line MUST start with a number, period, then <U>, <D>, <L>, or <R>".

Thus we will output lines like "1. <U> Move the player from (6,7) to (5,7), box positions are kept as (4,4), (5,5)".

We need to ensure that after each step, we update the coordinates accordingly.

Let's produce all 30 lines.

Double-check coordinates after each step:

- Step 1: from (6,7) to (5,7). Good.
- Step 2: from (5,7) to (4,7).
- Step 3: from (4,7) to (4,6).
- Step 4: from (4,6) to (4,5).
- Step 5: from (4,5) to (5,5), pushing box2 from (5,5) to (6,5). Player ends at (5,5). Boxes: (4,4),(6,5).
- Step 6: from (5,5) to (6,5), pushing box2 to (7,5). Player at (6,5). Boxes: (4,4),(7,5).
- Step 7: from (6,5) to (6,6).
- Step 8: from (6,6) to (7,6).
- Step 9: from (7,6) to (7,5), pushing box2 to (7,4). Player at (7,5). Boxes: (4,4),(7,4).
- Step 10: from (7,5) to (7,4), pushing box2 to (7,3). Player at (7,4). Boxes: (4,4),(7,3).
- Step 11: from (7,4) to (7,3), pushing box2 to (7,2). Player at (7,3). Boxes: (4,4),(7,2).
- Step 12: from (7,3) to (7,4).
- Step 13: from (7,4) to (7,5).
- Step 14: from (7,5) to (7,6).
- Step 15: from (7,6) to (7,7).
- Step 16: from (7,7) to (6,7).
- Step 17: from (6,7) to (5,7).
- Step 18: from (5,7) to (4,7).
- Step 19: from (4,7) to (4,6).
- Step 20: from (4,6) to (4,5).
- Step 21: from (4,5) to (4,4), pushing box1 to (4,3). Player at (4,4). Boxes: (4,3),(7,2).
- Step 22: from (4,4) to (4,3), pushing box1 to (4,2). Player at (4,3). Boxes: (4,2),(7,2).
- Step 23: from (4,3) to (4,4).
- Step 24: from (4,4) to (3,4).
- Step 25: from (3,4) to (2,4).
- Step 26: from (2,4) to (2,3).
- Step 27: from (2,3) to (2,2).
- Step 28: from (2,2) to (3,2).
- Step 29: from (3,2) to (4,2), pushing box1 to (5,2). Player at (4,2). Boxes: (5,2),(7,2).
- Step 30: from (4,2) to (5,2), pushing box1 to (6,2). Player at (5,2). Boxes: (6,2),(7,2).

Double-check that after step 30, boxes are on targets: (6,2) and (7,2). Good.

Now we need to output exactly 30 lines. Let's format each line correctly.

We must be careful with spaces: after comma after coordinates, we need a space. And after "box positions are kept as" or "updated to" we need a space before coordinates. Example: "box positions are kept as (3,3), (5,5)". So we will do same.

Also note that coordinates should be printed as (row,column). Use parentheses and comma. No extra spaces inside parentheses. Example shows "(7,7)" no spaces. So we should use "(6,7)" etc.

Thus each line: "1. <U> Move the player from (6,7) to (5,7), box positions are kept as (4,4), (5,5)".

We need to keep the order of boxes consistent. For updated moves, we need to update accordingly.

Let's produce the list.

We should double-check that after step 5, boxes are (4,4),(6,5). After step 6: (4,4),(7,5). After step 9: (4,4),(7,4). After step 10: (4,4),(7,3). After step 11: (4,4),(7,2). After step 21: (4,3),(7,2). After step 22: (4,2),(7,2). After step 29: (5,2),(7,2). After step 30: (6,2),(7,2). Good.

Now produce final output.assistantfinal1. <U> Move the player from (6,7) to (5,7), box positions are kept as (4,4), (5,5)
2. <U> Move the player from (
